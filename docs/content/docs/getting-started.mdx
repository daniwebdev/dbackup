# Getting Started with DBackup

This guide will help you set up your first backup in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. **Rust** 1.70 or higher (for building from source)
2. **Database Client Tools** - Must be installed on your system

<Callout title="Database Client Tools Required" type="warning">
You must have the appropriate database client tools installed:
- **PostgreSQL**: `pg_dump` command
- **MySQL**: `mysqldump` command

These tools are **required** for DBackup to function. Ensure they're installed and accessible in your system PATH.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Install DBackup

### Option A: Build from Source

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd db-backup-tools
cargo build --release
./target/release/dbackup --version
```

### Option B: Install with Cargo

```bash
cargo install --path .
dbackup --version
```

## Step 2: Generate Configuration

Create a sample configuration file:

```bash
dbackup generate -o backup.yml
cat backup.yml
```

This creates a template configuration that you'll customize next.

## Step 3: Configure Your First Backup

Edit the `backup.yml` file with your database details:

```yaml
settings:
  binary:
    pg_dump: /usr/bin/pg_dump

  storages:
    local_backup:
      driver: local
      path: "/var/backups/postgresql"
      filename_prefix: "backup_"

backups:
  - name: "Production Database"
    driver: postgresql
    connection:
      host: localhost
      port: 5432
      username: postgres
      password: your_password_here
      database: production_db
    mode: basic
    storage:
      ref: local_backup
```

**Configuration breakdown:**
- `connection`: Database connection details
- `mode`: `basic` (simple, smaller files) or `parallel` (faster, for large databases)
- `storage`: Where to save backups

## Step 4: Create Backup Directory

```bash
mkdir -p /var/backups/postgresql
chmod 755 /var/backups/postgresql
```

## Step 5: Test Your Configuration

Validate the configuration before running:

```bash
dbackup validate -c backup.yml
```

You should see:
```
✓ Configuration is valid
```

## Step 6: Run Your First Backup

```bash
dbackup backup -c backup.yml -n "Production Database"
```

This runs a one-time backup. You'll see output like:

```
[2026-02-18 15:45:30] Starting backup: Production Database
[2026-02-18 15:45:45] Backup completed successfully
[2026-02-18 15:45:45] Backup file: /var/backups/postgresql/backup_20260218_154530.dump.gz
```

## Step 7: Verify Your Backup

Check that the backup file was created:

```bash
ls -lh /var/backups/postgresql/
```

You should see your backup file (e.g., `backup_20260218_154530.dump.gz`).

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've created your first backup. Here's what you can do next:

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### "pg_dump: command not found"

**Solution:** Install PostgreSQL client tools (see Prerequisites section above)

```bash
# macOS
brew install postgresql

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client
```

### "Connection refused"

**Problem:** DBackup can't connect to your database

**Solution:** Check your database is running and connection details are correct:
```bash
telnet localhost 5432  # For PostgreSQL
```

### "Permission denied" on backup directory

**Solution:** Create the directory with proper permissions:
```bash
mkdir -p /var/backups/postgresql
sudo chown $USER:$USER /var/backups/postgresql
chmod 755 /var/backups/postgresql
```
